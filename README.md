# JAMS Ontology

The JAMS ontology module of the [Polifonia ontology network](https://github.com/polifonia-project/ontology-network) provides a comprehensive schema to describe JAMS files and their annotations.

The complete documentation of the ontology can be found at [https://polifonia-project.github.io/jams-ontology/](https://polifonia-project.github.io/jams-ontology/).

## Ontology Description

This ontology makes it possible to describe structured annotations from a JAMS file, as described in:

```
Eric J. Humphrey, Justin Salamon, Oriol Nieto, Jon Forsyth, Rachel M. Bittner, and Juan P. Bello,
"JAMS: A JSON Annotated Music Specification for Reproducible MIR Research",
Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval, 2014.
```

JAMS is a JSON-based music annotation format whioch aims to provide a simple, structured, and sustainable approach to representing rich information in a human-readable, language agnostic format.
JAMS is not only a formal scheme, but also a set of software tools that has been implemented to interact with this scheme. The annotation and software specifications can be found in the [official documentation](https://jams.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

However, the objective of this ontology module is not only to recreate the structure of a JAMS file in an RDF serialisation. Instead, the aim of this module of the Polifonia Ontology Network is to enrich the JAMS model with new information that is semantically consistent.

### JAMS Annotation

### JAMS Observation

The JAMS Ontology allows different types of JAMS Observation to be modelled.
For the sake of clarity, two different types are shown here in separate diagrams.
